  •	**In Chrome, click “Details” on each extension to see:** 
 <br>-	What permissions it has (e.g. "Read and change all your data on websites").

 <br>-	Search for the extension you're interested in.
 <br>-	Click on the extension to open its details page.
 <br>-	Scroll down to the section labelled as “Permissions” (you'll usually find it just below the description).
 <br>-	It will list what data the extension can access, such as:
 <br> 	 -> "Read and change all your data on the websites you visit"
 <br> 	 -> "Read your browsing history.
 <br> 	 -> "Access your tabs.
 <br>Pay attention here, especially for extensions that request broad or sensitive access.
 <br>-	On the extension's details page, scroll to the “Ratings and reviews” section

5. Identify any unused or suspicious extensions: 
Look for red flags like: 
 <br>•	Unknown developer
 <br>•	Poor reviews or low ratings
 <br>•	Unnecessary access (e.g. access to all websites, clipboard, etc.)
 <br>•	You don't remember installing it
 <br>•	It’s not from a trusted source

6. Remove suspicious or unnecessary extensions 
 <br>•	Click Remove or Trash icon next to the extension.

7. Research how malicious extensions can harm users
 <br>Malicious extensions can: </br>
 <br>•	Track browsing activity
 <br>•	Steal personal data or login info
 <br>•	Inject ads or redirect traffic
 <br>•	Hijack browser settings / History / Cookies (homepage, search engine).
 <br>•	Install malware.
